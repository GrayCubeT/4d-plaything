This is supposed to be a prototype of a 4d game. Labyrinth type where one player is able to view the whole map and guide the other to the exit. 

Unfortunately I have no clue how to make a 4d structure I need rendered in shaders, and normal rendering without shaders might be too slow and would not be the point.
I will come back to the project once I put up with the idea that this game is going to be not efficient at all.
